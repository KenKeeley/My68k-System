My68k System is a home built Motorola 680x0 based small computer project. It is made in the style of vintage computers of the mid
to late 1970's and early 1980's using a mix of classic and modern technologies. The My68k System is made up of a mainboard provding
basic input, output, memory and storage functions along with several expansion cards connected via expansion slots that are loosely
based on the VME standard although using card edge connectors.

The purpose of the My68k System is to entertain through education. It is intended to be used to teach and promote principles of
electronic computer design. It is a solely non-profit educational project and is not intended for any commercial application.
The My68k System and related peripherals would be ideal as a small project to teach basic computer hardware and software
principles.
